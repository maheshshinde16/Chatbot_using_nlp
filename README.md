# 🤖 Chatbot Using NLP

A Python-based chatbot that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand and respond to user queries. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying a simple chatbot using popular NLP libraries.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes and interprets user input using NLP techniques.
- **Intent Recognition**: Classifies user queries into predefined categories (intents).
- **Customizable Training Data**: Easily extend the bot’s functionality via the `intents.json` file.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Includes a Jupyter notebook for step-by-step implementation and explanation.
- **Standalone Script**: Deploy and interact with the bot via the command line using `chatbot.py`.

## 💡 Use Cases

- 💬 **Customer Support**: Automate answers to frequently asked questions.
- 📚 **Educational Assistant**: Provide academic help to students.
- 🔁 **FAQ Bot**: Quickly respond to common queries on websites or apps.
- 🧠 **Personal Assistant**: Answer general questions, provide reminders, or give recommendations.
